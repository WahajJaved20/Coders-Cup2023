# Coder's Cup Website

Welcome to the Coder's Cup website, where you can register as a participant for our exciting coding competition! This web application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and is hosted at [acmcoderscup.online](https://acmcoderscup.online).

## Participant Registration

To register as a participant for Coder's Cup, simply visit [acmcoderscup.online](https://acmcoderscup.online) and navigate to the registration page. Fill in the required details and get ready to showcase your coding skills in the competition.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing participant registration information securely.
- **Express.js:** A backend framework for building robust and scalable web applications.
- **React.js:** A frontend library for building user interfaces with reusable components.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime used for building the server-side of the application.

## CI/CD Pipelines on Azure

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are implemented on Azure to ensure a seamless development and deployment process. Any changes to the code trigger automated builds and deployments, allowing for efficient updates and improvements.

## Testing Using JEST

We prioritize the quality of our codebase, and that's why we use JEST, a JavaScript testing framework, for automated testing. This ensures that our application functions as expected and reduces the likelihood of bugs or issues.

## Getting Started (For Developers)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/coders-cup.git
   cd coders-cup
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your MongoDB database and configure the connection in the `.env` file.

4. Run the application locally:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
